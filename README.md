# JAVA-SOLUTIONS
# 🧬 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

This folder contains solutions to [HackerRank OOP Challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com). The focus here is on mastering the four pillars of OOP: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation.

## 📌 Featured Concept: Inheritance
In the [Java Inheritance I](https://www.hackerrank.com) challenge, I explored how a **subclass** derives attributes and behaviors from a **superclass**.

### Key Learnings:
* **The `extends` Keyword:** Used to create an "IS-A" relationship (e.g., a `Bird` is an `Animal`).
* **Method Reuse:** The `Bird` class automatically has access to the `walk()` method from `Animal` without rewriting it.
* **Specialization:** While inheriting general traits, the subclass can define its own unique behaviors like `fly()` and `sing()`.
